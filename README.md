# Marketing Strategy Development through Workation Data Analysis
**Topic: Travel Data Analysis for Regional Economic Revitalization and Workation Area Selection & Specialization Strategies**

**1. Project Introduction**

- **Background & Purpose:**  
  With outbound tourism increasing post-COVID-19, the project seeks ways to attract more domestic travelers, focusing on workation (work + vacation) as a method to increase weekday and long-term stays. By analyzing workation travel characteristics, the project aims to develop new workation products and collaborate with local governments to revitalize less active tourism areas through workation tourism.

- **Analysis Scope:**  
  - Identify activation factors for preferred workation regions.
  - Analyze travel types (accommodation, purpose, location, duration, accessibility).
  - Analyze visitor numbers and tourism spending to select optimal regions for workation and local economic revitalization.

- **Workation Concept & Status:**  
  Workation combines work and vacation, reflecting a new trend enabled by remote work post-pandemic. It is gaining attention as a countermeasure to regional decline and as part of the digital nomad movement.

**2. Analysis Plan**

- **[1] Descriptive & Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
  - Track annual trends in workation mentions and compare by region.
  - Analyze key tourism indicators (visitors, spending, accommodation rates).
  - Compare characteristics between active and inactive workation regions.
  - Identify factors influencing tourism activation.
  - Filter and select regions with high workation potential.

- ** Machine Learning-Based Prediction:**  
  - Use time series models (sARIMA) to forecast workation demand and identify high-potential regions.
  - Analyze seasonal patterns and develop response strategies.

- ** Clustering & Segmentation:**  
  - Use K-means to cluster regions by accommodation, travel purpose, companion type, and visit information.
  - Example clusters include:  
    - Nature/experience-focused, long-stay, low consumption  
    - Shopping/gastronomy-focused, high consumption, long-distance visitors  
    - History/culture-focused, short-stay, low consumption  
    - High consumption, workation-centric, mid-distance visitors

**3. Data Collection & Cleaning**

- **Data Sources:**  
  - Comprehensive tourism data by region from Jan 2021 to Aug 2024, using mobile, credit card, and SNS data.
  - 4,400 records, 57 features, covering 5 metropolitan and 103 local districts.

- **Key Metrics:**  
  - Visitor demographics, stay patterns, spending behavior, tourism trends, and social mentions.

- **Collection Method:**  
  - Web crawling from Korea Tourism Data Lab.
  - Automated monthly data collection and standardization.

- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Standardize and merge CSV files.
  - Handle missing values by cross-checking with originals, using averages or zeros as appropriate.
  - Normalize and restructure data for analysis.
  - Remove unnecessary columns and generate derived variables.

**4. Data Analysis**

- **Descriptive Statistics:**  
  - Visitor numbers show a wide distribution, with concentration in certain regions.
  - Tourism spending has high variance, with some regions showing much higher values.
  - Stay duration and accommodation ratios are stable overall, but some regions show extreme values.
  - Workation mentions have increased steadily, though growth is slowing.

- **Key Findings:**  
  - Regions like Gangwon, Seoul, Busan, Jeju, and Gyeonggi have the highest workation mentions.
  - Busan saw a 933% increase in mentions from 2021 to 2024.
  - Long-stay ratios correlate positively with tourism spending in workation-preferred regions.
  - Short-stay ratios correlate with overall workation mentions.
  - Nature tourism and experiential activities are increasingly linked to workation interest.

**5. Machine Learning & Clustering**

- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Adjust long/short-stay ratios, select 22 core variables, standardize data, and use PCA for dimensionality reduction.

- **Clustering Results:**  
  - Four clusters identified, each with distinct travel purposes, spending, and visitor characteristics (e.g., long-stay nature tourists, high-spending shoppers, short-stay culture tourists, high-consumption workationers).

- **Time Series Forecasting:**  
  - Used SARIMA models to predict workation potential for specific regions (e.g., Chuncheon, Yeongdo).
  - Included trend, seasonality, and volatility analysis, with future projections for 12–24 months.

**6. Content Marketing Strategy**

- **Trends:**  
  - Workation interest is rising, especially in Gangwon and Busan, though growth is slowing in Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Jeju.
  - Top 30% workation regions have higher visitor numbers, spending, and accommodation rates, but lower long-stay ratios.

- **Key Elements:**  
  - Long-stay workations contribute more to local economies.
  - Nature tourism and experiential activities are core drivers for workation.
  - Family-oriented and freelancer/entrepreneur personas are prominent.

- **Marketing Recommendations:**  
  - Emphasize family workation benefits in content (videos, blogs).
  - Highlight nature and experience programs in Chuncheon and Yeongdo.
  - Promote advantages of long stays (efficiency, family time, cost savings).
  - Provide information on accommodations, co-working spaces, and government support.

- **Target Personas:**  
  - Freelancers/digital nomads (35–45, value work-life separation, need both workspace and tourism).
  - Working families (30s–40s, use vacation days for family trips, value child-friendly activities).
  - Corporate workation managers (considering programs for employee welfare and efficiency).

**7. Conclusion**

- Chuncheon and Yeongdo were selected as high-potential workation regions based on data-driven criteria (high mentions but low visitors, improving long-stay and spending correlations).
- Clusters show that nature/experience-based, long-stay, family-oriented workations have untapped potential.
- Long-stay workation marketing and support can drive local economic revitalization, especially in regions with improving long-stay and spending correlations.
